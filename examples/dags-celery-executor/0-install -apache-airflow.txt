# Install Apache Airflow

## Prerequisites

First, make sure you have installed Docker Desktop and Visual Studio. If not, take a look at these links:

- Get Docker : https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
- Get Visual Studio Code : https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Docker needs privilege rights to work, make sure you have them.

## Follow the documentation first.
If you have trouble to install these tools, here are some videos to help you

## Install Apache Airflow with Docker


### 1. Create a folder materials in your Documents

### 2. In this folder, download the following file: docker compose file (https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.5.1/docker-compose.yaml)

### 3. If you right-click on the file and save it, you will end up with docker-compose.yaml.txt. Remove the .txt and keep docker-compose.yaml

### 4. Open your terminal or CMD and go into Documents/materials

### 5. Open Visual Studio Code by typing the command: code .

### 6. Right click below docker-compose.yml and create a new file .env (don't forget the dot before env)
In this file add the following lines and save the file

```
AIRFLOW_IMAGE_NAME=apache/airflow:2.4.2
AIRFLOW_UID=50000
```

### 7. Go at the top bar of Visual Studio Code -> Terminal -> New Terminal


### 8. In your new terminal at the bottom of Visual Studio Code, run the command 

```
docker-compose up -d
docker compose up -d
```

You will see many lines scrolled, wait until it's done. Docker is downloading Airflow to run it. It can take up to 5 mins depending on your connection. If Docker raises an error saying it can't download the docker image, ensure you are not behind a proxy/vpn or corporate network. You may need to use your personal connection to make it work. At the end, you should end up with something like this:

Well done, you've just installed Apache Airflow with Docker! ðŸŽ‰

Open your web browser and go to localhost:8080


## Troubleshoots
-> If you don't see this page, make sure you have nothing already running on the port 8080

Also, go back to your terminal on Visual Studio Code and check your application with 

```
docker-compose ps
```

All of your "containers" should be healthy as follow:

If a container is not healthy. You can check the logs with 

```
docker logs materials_name_of_the_container
```

Try to spot the error; once you fix it, restart Airflow with 

```docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

and wait until your container states move from starting to healthy.

-> If you see this error remove your volumes with

```
docker volume prune
docker-compose up -d 
```

-> If you see that airflow-init docker container has exited, that's normal :)
